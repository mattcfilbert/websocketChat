# Connect2by4

This is a silly messaging/dating app that only lets you talk by playing connect 4.

The rules of connect 4 currently don't apply, but all that logic and all those restrictions are hogwash that throw off the flow of conversation. Realizing that there are technically no constraints, players can talk freely and laugh at the incongruity of their own expectations with this shitty app.

It was built using a poor application of both Angular and websockets.
